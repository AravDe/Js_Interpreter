# Js_Interpreter
Building a JS interpreter.

## Initial Goals:
Loops (while, for, do-while, repeat-until, etc.)  
Conditionals (all comparison operators, <, >, !=, ==, etc., or equivalents (for example, BASIC uses <> for not equal); IF and IF / ELSE constructs  
Assignment / Variables / Global Scope  
Functions / with local variables / with optional parameters / local scope / Allows Recursion / etc.  
Input / Output from and to the console (screen)  
Basic primitive data types: integers, floats, chars, strings  

## Additional Goals:
One complex JS function, async or await or EventListener.

## Base Interpreter : 
For the class I am building this in, I have to build it using a python interpreter.
